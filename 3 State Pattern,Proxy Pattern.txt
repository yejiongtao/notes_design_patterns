1. State Pattern
	allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes
		The object will appear to change its class.
	in English
		instead of keeping a integer in the class to keep track of the current state
			and then use switch..case in each method
		create an abstract class named State, with some abstract methods
		extend State to implemnet concrete state class
		then the Context just keep track of the State object and call its method when certain issue happens

2. Proxy Pattern

RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
	RMI gives us a way to find objects in a remote JVM and allows us to invoke their methods.
